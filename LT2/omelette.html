        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul> 
         <li>2 eggs</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons grated cheese, any kind</li>
         <li>3 to 4 cherry tomatoes, peeled and split in half with a small sprinkle of salt</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons chopped basil, parsley, or herb of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Method</h2>
        <li><p>Prepare the eggs. With a fork, beat the eggs in a bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Melt the butter</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook the eggs in the skillet without stirring until they begin to set around the edges. Push the sides of the pan toward the center with a silicone spatula and tilt the pan so the raw eggs slide to the edge.
        Repeat for another 6 minutes, or until the eggs are mostly set but still a bit soft in the center.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook for about 1 minute longer, or until the eggs are mostly set but still a bit soft in the center, before adding the cheese, tomatoes, and herbs in a line down the center of the omelette.</p></li>
        <li><p>To loosen the omelette, run the spatula around one side at the edge. It can be slipped under the eggs and used to fold the omelette in half neatly. To remove the folded omelette from the pan, slide the spatula under it. Tilt the pan over a plate and nudge it onto the plate with the spatula. Voila!</p></li>
