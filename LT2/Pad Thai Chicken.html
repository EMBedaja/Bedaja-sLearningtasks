        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

         <li>125 g / 4oz Chang’s Pad Thai dried rice stick</li>
         <li>1 1/2 tbsp tamarind puree</li>
         <li>3 tbsp (packed) brown sugar</li>
         <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
         <li>1 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
         <li>2 – 3 tbsp vegetable or canola oil</li>
         <li>1/2 onion</li>
         <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
         <li>150 g/5oz chicken breast (or thigh)</li>
         <li>2 eggs</li>
         <li>1 1/2 cups of beansprouts</li>
         <li>1/2 cup firm tofu, cut into 3cm / 1 1/4″ batons</li>
         <li>1/4 cup garlic chives , cut into 3cm / 1 1/4″ pieces</li>
         <li>1/4 cup finely chopped peanuts</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Method</h2>
        <li><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the noodles and a big amount of boiling water. Soak for 5 minutes, then drain and rinse under cold water in a colander. Do not leave them to sit for longer than 5–10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Mix Sauce in small bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a large nonstick skillet (or well-seasoned skillet), heat 2 tablespoons oil over high heat. Cook for 30 seconds after adding the garlic and onion.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook for 1 1/2 minutes, or until chicken is almost cooked through.</p></li>
        <li><p>Push to one side of the pan, then pour in the egg on the other. Using the wooden spoon, scramble the eggs (adding a touch of more oil if the pan is too dry), then fold into the chicken.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add bean sprouts, tofu, noodles then Sauce.</p></li>
        <li><p>Toss for about 1 1/2 minutes, or until the sauce is completely absorbed by the noodles.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add half of the peanuts and the garlic chives. Remove from heat after a brief tossing.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve immediately with a sprinkle of chili and a handful of additional beansprouts on the side, as well as the remaining peanuts and lime wedges. Before eating, squeeze over some lime juice to taste.</p></li>
