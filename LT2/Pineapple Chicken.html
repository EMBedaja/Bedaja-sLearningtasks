        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul> 
         <li>2 chicken breasts cut into 1" pieces</li>
         <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
         <li>Pepper</li>
         <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
         <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
         <li>2 (8 fluid ounce) cans pineapple tidbits or chunks</li>
         <li>1/2 red bell pepper cut into bite-size pieces</li>
         <li>1/2 medium onion sliced or cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <b> Sauce:</b>
         <li>3/4 cup pineapple juice (from the canned pineapple)</li>
         <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon fresh ginger grated</li>
         <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <li><p>In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients. If you don't have exactly enough pineapple juice to create 3/4 cup, simply add water to make up the difference. Whisk until the mixture is completely smooth.</p></li>
       <li><p>Prepare the veggies.</p></li>
      <li><p>Stir the chicken with the garlic powder and pepper in a bowl, then add the cornstarch and toss until evenly covered.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a deep pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Allow a few minutes for the pan to heat up. Cook the chicken in two batches in order to avoid overcrowding the pan. Cook for 4 minutes before flipping and cooking for another 3-4 minutes. Brown the chicken and make sure it's fully done (165F). I add another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan for the second batch. When the chicken is done, transfer it to a platter in slices.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the pan is dry, drizzle with a tiny amount of olive oil (about a teaspoon) before adding the pineapple. Allow it to cook for approximately a minute without stirring.</p></li>
       <li><p>Cook for another 3 minutes, stirring often, after adding the peppers and onions. Tender-crisp vegetables will be served. If desired, cook for a few minutes longer.</p></li>
      <li><p>Return the chicken to the pan and then add the sauce. Allow it to boil for 1-2 minutes until it thickens, then remove from the heat and serve immediately over rice or noodles.</p></li>
