        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul> 
         <li>7 ounces granulated sugar (1 cup; 200g)</li>
         <li> 12 large egg yolks (8 ounces; 225g)</li>
         <li> One 12-ounce (355ml) can evaporated milk</li>
         <li>Two 14-ounce (800ml) cans sweetened condensed milk</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
         <li> 1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest from 1 lemon</li>
        
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C) with the rack in the middle position. To use in a water bath while baking, bring 3 quarts (2.8L) water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring constantly with a fork, until sugar dissolves and syrup is a rich copper colored color, about 5 minutes, in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour the hot caramel onto an 8-inch square baking dish that is oven-safe, making sure the bottom is evenly coated. Set aside</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg yolks, evaporated milk, condensed milk, and vanilla extract in a medium mixing dish until fully blended. Using a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl, drain the mixture (this ensures that your flan will be smooth).</li>
       <li>Pour the egg mixture into the caramel-lined baking dish. To pop any bubbles, lightly tap the dish on a work surface. Cover with foil and equally sprinkle lemon zest on top. Poke 2 1/2-inch slits in the foil with the point of a sharp knife to let moisture to escape and not condense over the flan while it bakes.</li>
        <li>Set a wire rack in the bottom of a roasting dish, casserole dish, or other high-walled, oven-safe dish, and place the flan-filled dish on top. Preheat oven to 350°F. Fill the roasting dish halfway with boiling water and carefully pour it into the flan-filled dish.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 1 hour, or until the flan is just set to the touch in the center and an instant read thermometer reads 175°F (80°C) in the center.</li>
        <li>Transfer flan to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cool fully in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>To serve, loosen the flan from the plate with a paring knife or an offset spatula. Place an upside-down bigger plate on top of the flan-filled dish, then flip both dishes over quickly to invert the flan and capture the caramel sauce. Serve by slicing the cake into 36 one-inch squares.</li>
