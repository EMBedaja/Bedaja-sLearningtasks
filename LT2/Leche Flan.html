        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul> 
         <li>7 ounces granulated sugar (1 cup; 200g)</li>
         <li> 12 large egg yolks (8 ounces; 225g)</li>
         <li> One 12-ounce (355ml) can evaporated milk</li>
         <li>Two 14-ounce (800ml) cans sweetened condensed milk</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
         <li> 1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest from 1 lemon</li>
        
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 325°F (163°C). Bring 3 quarts (2.8L) water to a boil to use in a water bath during baking.</li>
        <li>In a 2-quart saucepan, place sugar over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly with a fork, until sugar melts and syrup is a deep copper brown color, about 5 minutes. Carefully pour the hot caramel into an oven-safe 8-inch square baking dish, making sure the bottom is evenly coated with caramel. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together egg yolks, evaporated milk, condensed milk, and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl (this ensures that your flan will be smooth).</li>
       <li>Pour egg mixture into the prepared caramel-lined dish. Tap dish gently on a work surface to pop any bubbles. Sprinkle lemon zest evenly over top and cover with foil. With the tip of a sharp knife, poke 2 1/2-inch slits in the foil so moisture can escape and won’t condense onto your flan as it bakes..</li>
        <li>In a roasting dish, casserole dish, or another high-walled, oven-safe dish, set a wire rack in the bottom and place the foil-covered flan-filled dish on top. Place in oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting dish until about halfway up the side of the flan-filled dish.</li>
        <li>Bake until flan is just set to the touch, with a slight jiggle in the center, and an instant read thermometer reads 175°F (80°C) in the center, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Transfer flan to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cool fully in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>To serve, run a paring knife or offset spatula along the edge to loosen the flan from the dish. Set a larger plate, upside down, on top of flan-filled dish, then quickly flip both dishes over to invert the flan and catch the caramel sauce. Slice into 36 one-inch squares and serve.</li>
