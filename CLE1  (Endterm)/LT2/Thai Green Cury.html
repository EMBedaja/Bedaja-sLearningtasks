        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul> 
         <li>1¾ cup coconut milk, divided</li>
         <li>50 g (~3 Tbsp) green curry paste, store bought or homemade</li>
         <li>1 cup chicken stock, unsalted</li>
         <li>1 lb chicken thigh, boneless, skinless, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
         <li>2 Tbsp palm sugar, finely chopped</li>
         <li>1½ - 2 Tbsp fish sauce</li>
         <li>3-4 kaffir lime leaves, roughly torn</li>
         <li>1½ cup bamboo shoots, canned</li>
         <li>1 cup Thai basil</li>
         <li>1 spur chilies or ¼ red bell pepper, julienned</li>
         <li>Jasmine rice for serving</li>
         
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Method</h2>
        <li><p>Reduce 3/4 cup coconut milk until thick and coconut oil begins to separate from the coconut milk (if the oil does not separate after the coconut milk has been reduced to a very thick consistency, that's OK; simply continue with the procedure).</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the curry paste and cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes over medium heat, until fragrant. If the paste adheres to the bottom of the pan, use a little of the leftover coconut milk to deglaze it.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir in the chicken thigh to incorporate it into the paste.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the kaffir lime leaves, chicken stock, 1 cup coconut milk, palm sugar, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce to the pot. Bring to a low boil, then reduce to a low heat and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is fork tender.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the bamboo shoots and bring to a boil after the curry has finished simmering. Add the peppers at this point if you want them to be more cooked. Remove the pot from the heat after it has reached a boil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Taste and adjust the seasoning with extra fish sauce and/or sugar as required.</p></li>
        <li><p>Thai basil and spur chilies or bell peppers should be added at this point.</p></li>
        <li><p> Serve with rice</p></li>
