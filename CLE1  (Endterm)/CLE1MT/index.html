                <p style="text-align: center"><b>We all have the same human rights.</b></p>
                <p style="text-align: center">But for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people worldwide, being open and out means dealing with discrimination, harassment, or worse.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center">Human rights are unique in that they belong to everyone simply because they are human, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, handicap, financial or social standing, or any other distinguishing aspect. However, LGBTQ people's human rights are frequently ignored, intentionally rejected, and violated in horrifying ways on a daily basis all across the world.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center" > Many LGBTQ people continue to confront discrimination in their personal lives, the employment, and the public discourse, as well as in their ability to get crucial health care. Many LGBTQ people describe modifying their life to avoid this discrimination and the anguish associated with unequal treatment. Younger generations report higher levels of discrimination and related issues than older generations, with discrimination problems being particularly prominent among transgender people, people of color, and people with disabilities.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center"> <b> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>
                <p style="text-align: center"> By virtue of being human, everyone has the claim to human rights. However, LGBTQ people's human rights are not recognized, aggressively rejected, and violated in horrifying ways on a daily basis all across the world. This is a huge injustice for a large number of people in communities all throughout the world.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center"> Regardless of where we reside, LGBTQ individuals have the freedom to be who we are and love whom we want.</p>
