                <p>  Only 11 countries in the world have constitutions that protect people from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. We should assist people in overturning discriminatory legislation and enshrining LGBTQ rights in law.</p>

                <p> It has been established that greater economic inclusiveness benefits emerging economies. We should support in ensuring that LGBTQ persons have access to the resources and rights they require to succeed in the workplace.</p>

                <p> Despite significant advances, there remains a big global difference on LGBTQ rights. We help others in providing knowledge and raising awareness in order to foster good, accepting communities.</p>

                <p> LGBTQ people are often persecuted, and their lives and livelihoods are harmed. We should provide health care and safe sanctuary to LGBTQ people who are vulnerable to persecution.</p>

                <p> LGBTQ people still lack proper access to justice in many countries. We should support in providing pro bono legal assistance to LGBTQ individuals who are facing discriminatory legal action.</p>
