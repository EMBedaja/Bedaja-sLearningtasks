                <p style="text-align: center"> Ever since I laid my eyes on you, <br> <br>
                I already know that my heart's pumping on you.<br> <br>
                Even though you don't know my name, <br> <br>
                Just don't treat my feelings as a game.<br> <br>
                You're my Idol and I'm just your fan, <br> <br>
                Hoping that someday you'll hold my hand.<br> <br>
                I know this is crazy too, <br> <br>
                But please know that my feelings are true.<br> <br> <br> <br>
            
                
                You are miles away from me, <br> <br>
                Only in TVs and Computers, as you can see. <br> <br>
                Celebrity crush, as they call it, <br> <br>
                But for me, it's love in every bit. <br> <br>
                Whenever I see a shooting star, <br> <br>
                I make a wish to see you in personal.<br> <br>
                That someday, you would be near, <br><br> 
                And know my feelings here. <br> <br> <br> <br>
                In everything I do, <br><br>
                you serve as an inspiration. <br><br>
                That's why I thank you, <br><br>
                For being there in every situation. <br><br>
                When I see your picture or hear your voice, <br><br>
                I would scream, shout and make some noise.<br><br>
                Only by looking at it, you would make me happy, <br><br>
                In times when I feel lonely. <br><br> <br><br>
                You're my Idol, and I'm just your fan. <br><br>
                But I'm hoping someday, that for you, <br><br>
                I will not just be your fan, <br><br>
                But can also be your love one.  <br>
                =). <br> <br><br>
